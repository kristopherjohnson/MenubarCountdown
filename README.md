Menubar Countdown
-----------------

_Menubar Countdown_ is a simple countdown timer displayed in the
macOS menu bar.  It can be used as a [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique),
to remind yourself to get back to work after a break, or whenever you want
to quickly set a time limit on some activity.

To set the timer, click the menu bar icon and select the **Start...** menu item.
A dialog will appear allowing you to specify the countdown time in hours,
minutes, and seconds. The dialog also allows you to specify which of the
following forms of notification you want when the timer gets down to 00:00:00:

- Blink the icon in the menu bar.
- Play the system alert sound.
- Display an alert window.
- Display a notification in Notification Center.
- Make a spoken announcement. You can specify the text to be spoken.

The countdown timer can be controlled using AppleScript, JavaScript, or Swift.
See the examples in the
[Scripts](https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/MenubarCountdown/tree/master/Scripts)
directory for details.
